a simple Python script that automatically navigates through multiple pages of "TagBoxGallery" website, vists each image`s page, and downloads the image using Selenium WebDriver.


Requirements are only Python 3.x and Google Chrome Browser installed. the ChromeDriver is automatically handled as I`m using webdriver-manager.

To run this simply clone the repository, install the dependencies and then run the script by typing python main.py. By default I have set it for 94 pages as thats what my original gallery had.
